footer still goes below address bar on mobile when tab is closed

scrolling text doesnt loop perfectly

if page is scrolled then refreshed, logo is out of frame

when going into landscape mode with a tab expanded on mobile, the emoji waterfall appears above the tabs rather than remaining behind the footer

launching the page in landscape mode on mobile also causes this, and the when it doesnt the footer is not visible
